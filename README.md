# Oasis Infobyte Internship - Car Price Prediction Model 🚗💰

Welcome to the Oasis Infobyte Internship Car Price Prediction Model repository! 🎉

## Task Description 📝

Develop a data-driven model to accurately predict car prices based on relevant features.

## Author 👩‍💻

- **Author:** Rupa Navale

## Project Structure 📁

- **Notebook:** [Car Price Prediction.ipynb](Car%20Price%20Prediction.ipynb) - Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation code.

## Implementation Steps 🛠️

1. **Importing Necessary Libraries:** Import required libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and Google Colab utilities. 📚

2. **Loading and Exploring the Dataset:** Load the dataset and explore its basic information, shape, data types, and statistical summary. 📊📈

3. **Data Preprocessing:** Perform data preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables and selecting relevant features. 🧹🔍

4. **Splitting Data:** Split the dataset into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function. 📊➡️📈

5. **Training the Model:** Create a Linear Regression model and train it on the training data using the `fit` method. 🤖🧠

6. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the model's performance on both the training and testing datasets using the R-squared score. Visualize the predicted prices against the actual prices. 📊🔍💡

## Usage 🚀

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash git clone https://github.com/rupanavale/OIBSIP-Task-3

2. Open and run the Car Price Prediction.ipynb notebook using Jupyter or Google Colab.

## Results 📈🔍
The model has been trained and evaluated on the provided dataset. The R-squared score indicates how well the model fits the data, with a perfect score of 1.0 on both training and testing data.

## Acknowledgments 🙏
This project was completed as part of the Oasis Infobyte Internship program. Special thanks to the entire Oasis Infobyte team! 👏
